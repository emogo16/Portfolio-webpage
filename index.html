<h3>My Family</h3>

<h4>How is my family and Epicodus related?</h4>
<p>My husband in particular has been my number one supporter in my programming journey. He has helped me relized that I am capable of doing things I did not know I could do. He has been very supporting when it comes to working extra hours so that I can work less and put more time into programming.</p> 
<p>Below I will show you a list of projects I have created (with the help of Epicodus) with links to the GitHub repositories(most are work in progress).</p>
