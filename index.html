    <h3>About me and why I am here at Epicodus</h3>
    <div class="aboutme">I am here for one major reason and that is because growing up I always was drawn to copmuters. I always told myslef that I wanted to be a prgromamer but my family had other plans and wanted to me to study medicine. I did want to study medicine in a way due to my grandmother passing due to cardiac arrest. I was upset because she was turned away in the US because she had previous hospital debt and could not perfrom the surgery. Her passing motivated me and I finsihed my Bachelors degree in Biology Pre-Med, but there was a void I was still missing in my life and that was programming. </p>
