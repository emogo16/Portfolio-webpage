    <h3>How is my family and Epicodus related?</h3>
    <p>My husband in particular has been my number one supporter in my programming journey. He has helped me relized that I am capable of doing things I did not know I could do. He has been very supporting when it comes to working extra hours so that I can work less and put more time into programming.</p>

    <h3>About me and why I am here at Epicodus</h3>
    <p>I am here for one major reason and that is because growing up I always was drawn to copmuters. I always told myslef that I wanted to be a prgromamer but my family had other plans and wanted to me to study medicine. I did want to study medicine in a way due to my grandmother passing due to cardiac arrest. I was upset because she was turned away in the US because she had previous hospital debt and could not perfrom the surgery. Her passing motivated me and I finsihed my Bachelors degree in Biology Pre-Med, but there was a void I was still missing in my life and that was programming. </p>
